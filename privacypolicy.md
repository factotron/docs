# Astral Development Privacy Policy

This document outlines the privacy policy and agreements that you accept when adding any of Astral Development's applications or bots to to a Discord guild/server, or as a member of a guild/server where any of the aforementioned bots are enabled.

## Bots and Services

This policy applies to the following Discord bots that we operate:

* Factotron#1695

## Data Collected

When a bot is added to a guild/server, the following data may be collected and stored. This data is used to provide statistics data to assist further development.

* The number of members in a guild/server
* The amount/frequency of command activations

When a command to the bot is issued by a guild member or administrator, the following data may be collected and stored.

* The triggering member's unique ID
* The guild's unique ID
* The unique ID of the channel the command is triggered in
* The permissions of the member (this is only stored in memory while the bot is running)
* Server configuration details
* Data for automated tasks

## Data Storage

All data is stored in a secured MongoDB database to prevent external access. Although we take every step to secure this data, no database is 100% secure and the Astral Development team assume no liabiliy for unintentional or malicious breach of data. In the case this happens we will notify all affected users via the Discord client.
Your data is automatically deleted when you remove our services from a Discord guild/server.

## Data Uses

Your data is only used to provide, develop and maintain our services listed above. Access to your data is strictly controlled and is only permitted to the developers of our services. We do not sell or share your data with any third party except when required to by law. Certain statistics data may be anonymized and aggregated to provide information for our community (for example the bot's server count or the usage levels of a certain command).

## Data Requests

To request a copy of your data, data deletion, or have a privacy/security concern, please send an email to `sonosusoshwa@gmail.com`

Astral Development reserves the right to review and modify this privacy policy at any time without notifying users. It is your responsibility to view this policy regularly to familiarise yourself with any changes.
